            <p class="lustria_font">
                When I set my mind to do something, I get whatever needs to be done, done. I’m very motivated because of this. 
                <br><br>
                As a human, I have weaknesses like everone else.
                <br>
                Some of my weaknesses include:
                <li>Being too detail oriented</li>
                <li>Overachieving</li>
                <li>Being too critical of myself</li>
                <br>
                While I do recognize that I encounter these weaknesses frequently, 
                I am learning how to hold myself accountable and am working to strengthen them.
                <br>
                My strengths include:
                <li>Being creative</li>
                <li>Passionate about my work</li>
                <li>Being a great problem solver</li>
                <br>
                As these are a few of my strengths, I find myself improving them every day and growing as an individual.

            <h2 class="lustria_font" style="margin-bottom: 1vw;">The Not-So-Serious</h2>
            <p class="lustria_font">
                When I learn new things or notice a difference in myself, I get so excited. It’s like wow, that’s new! 
                That’s something I didn’t know yesterday.
                <br><br>
                When I don’t understand how or why something works, I dedicated time into learning about it.
                <br><br>
                When I’m not doing research on something, you can usually catch me with either a book in my hand or a puzzle in front of me. 
                I love all kinds of puzzles ranging from Sudoku to 1000 piece jigsaws.
                <br>
                Oh, and I loooooove the show, “Rick and Morty”.
                <br><br>
                I love creating things. I have a small group of songs I’ve produced under my belt as well as a few short stories.
                <br><br>
                I also love spending time with my family and biking around my town.
                <br><br>
                If anything about me resonated with you, I’d love to connect and talk about it (or anything else)!
